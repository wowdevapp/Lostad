## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository and start the development server:

- `git clone git@github.com:wowdevapp/imense-test.git`
- `npm install`
- Create a `.env.local` file by copying the example environment file:
  `cp env.example.txt .env.local`
- Add the required environment variables to the `.env.local` file.
- `npm run dev`

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000.
